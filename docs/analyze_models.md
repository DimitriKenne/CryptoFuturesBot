# **Understanding the analyze\_model.py Script and its Results**

The analyze\_model.py script is a crucial component of your algorithmic trading bot project. Its primary purpose is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of a trained machine learning model's performance on unseen data, generating various metrics and visualizations to help you understand its strengths and weaknesses.

## Script Purpose

This script performs the following key functions:

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**: It loads the processed features and labeled data for a specified trading pair and interval. It then merges and cleans this data (handling NaNs and infinite values) and performs a time-series split to create a dedicated test set.  
2. **Model Loading**: It loads a previously trained **ModelTrainer** instance, which encapsulates your machine learning model (e.g., **RandomForest**, **XGBoost**, **LSTM**) and its associated preprocessing pipeline (including scaling and optional **PCA**).  
3. **Prediction and Evaluation**: It uses the loaded model to make predictions and predict probabilities on the prepared test set. It then calculates a suite of performance metrics.  
4. **Results Saving**: It saves the calculated evaluation metrics to a file for record-keeping.  
5. **Visualization**: It generates various plots to visually represent the model's performance and insights, such as feature importance and probability distributions.

## How to Run the Script

You can run the script from your project's root directory using the command line:

python scripts/analyze\_model.py \--symbol ADAUSDT \--interval 5m \--model random\_forest \--train\_ratio 0.8

* \--symbol: The trading pair (e.g., BTCUSDT, ADAUSDT).  
* \--interval: The candlestick interval (e.g., 5m, 1h).  
* \--model: The key for the trained model type (e.g., random\_forest, xgboost, lstm). This must match a key in your **config/params.py** **MODEL\_CONFIG**.  
* \--train\_ratio: (Optional) The proportion of data to use for training (the rest is for testing). Default is **0.8**.

**Prerequisites**: Before running **analyze\_model.py**, ensure you have:

* Generated processed data (features) using your feature engineering script.  
* Generated labeled data using your labeling script.  
* Successfully trained and saved a model for the specified symbol, interval, and model type using **train\_model.py**.

## Interpreting the Results

The script outputs logs to the console and generates various files (metrics and plots) in your **results/analysis/model/** directory (specifically, **results/analysis/model/{model\_key}/**).

### 1\. Logged Metrics

The console output will provide a summary of key metrics:

* **Overall Accuracy**:  
  * **Interpretation**: The proportion of total predictions that were correct.  
  * **Consideration**: While easy to understand, it can be misleading for imbalanced datasets. If **90%** of your labels are '**0**' (neutral), a model predicting '**0**' all the time would have **90%** accuracy but be useless.  
* **Balanced Accuracy**:  
  * **Interpretation**: The average of recall obtained on each class. It's a more robust metric for imbalanced datasets as it gives equal weight to each class.  
  * **Consideration**: This is often a better indicator of true model performance than overall accuracy when class distributions are uneven.  
* **Classification Report**:  
  * **Interpretation**: Provides **precision**, **recall**, and **f1-score** for each class (**\-1**, **0**, **1**).  
    * **Precision**: Of all predictions made for a specific class, what proportion were actually correct? (e.g., "Of all times the model predicted 'Buy', how many were actual 'Buys'?")  
    * **Recall**: Of all actual instances of a specific class, what proportion did the model correctly identify? (e.g., "Of all actual 'Buy' opportunities, how many did the model find?")  
    * **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances both metrics and is a good single measure for a class.  
  * **Consideration**: Analyze these metrics per class. For trading, you might prioritize high precision for 'Buy' or 'Sell' signals to avoid false trades, or high recall to capture most opportunities.  
* **Confusion Matrix**:  
  * **Interpretation**: A table showing the counts of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.  
    * Rows represent the *true* labels.  
    * Columns represent the *predicted* labels.  
    * The diagonal elements show correctly classified instances.  
    * Off-diagonal elements show misclassifications.  
  * **Example (Ternary Classification):**  
    \[\[True \-1, Predicted \-1\], \[True \-1, Predicted 0\], \[True \-1, Predicted 1\]\]  
    \[\[True 0, Predicted \-1\],  \[True 0, Predicted 0\],  \[True 0, Predicted 1\]\]  
    \[\[True 1, Predicted \-1\],  \[True 1, Predicted 0\],  \[True 1, Predicted 1\]\]

  * **Consideration**: This is a visual and detailed breakdown of where your model is succeeding and failing. For instance, if your model frequently predicts '**0**' when the true label is '**1**' (false negatives for 'Buy'), you'll see a high number in the **\[True 1, Predicted 0\]** cell.

### 2\. Generated Plots

The script saves several **.png** plot files in the model's analysis directory (e.g., **results/analysis/model/random\_forest/**).

* **Confusion Matrix Plot (\*\_confusion\_matrix.png)**:  
  * **Interpretation**: A heatmap visualization of the confusion matrix, making it easier to spot patterns of misclassification. Darker shades on the diagonal are good. Bright off-diagonal cells indicate common errors.  
  * **Consideration**: Visually confirms the numerical confusion matrix.  
* **Feature Importance Plot (\*\_feature\_importance.png)**:  
  * **Interpretation**: Shows which features the model considered most important for making predictions. For tree-based models (**RandomForest**, **XGBoost**), this is often based on how much each feature reduces impurity (e.g., Gini impurity or gain).  
  * **Consideration**: Helps in understanding which market indicators or engineered features are driving your model's decisions. This can guide further feature engineering or selection. If **PCA** was used, these will be the importance of the principal components.  
* **Prediction Probability Distributions (\*\_probability\_distributions.png)**:  
  * **Interpretation**: Histograms showing the distribution of predicted probabilities for each class, often separated by the *true* label.  
    * **Well-calibrated models**: Should show high probabilities for the true class clustered near **1**, and low probabilities for other classes clustered near **0**.  
    * **Overconfident models**: Might predict probabilities very close to **0** or **1** even when uncertain.  
    * **Underconfident models**: Might predict probabilities clustered around **0.5** (for binary) or **0.33** (for ternary).  
  * **Consideration**: Essential for understanding model confidence. If your model predicts a "Buy" with **51%** probability versus **95%** probability, the latter is more trustworthy. This is crucial for implementing confidence-based filtering in your trading strategy.  
* **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC) (\*\_roc\_auc\_curve.png)**:  
  * **Interpretation**:  
    * **ROC Curve**: Plots the True Positive Rate (**TPR**, or Recall) against the False Positive Rate (**FPR**) at various classification thresholds.  
    * **AUC**: The area under the **ROC** curve. A value of **1.0** indicates a perfect classifier, while **0.5** indicates a random classifier.  
  * **Consideration**: A high **AUC** (closer to **1**) means the model is good at distinguishing between classes. For multi-class, a curve is plotted for each class against all others (one-vs-rest).  
* **Precision-Recall** Curve (\*\_precision\_recall\_curve.png**)**:  
  * **Interpretation**: Plots precision against recall for various thresholds.  
  * **Consideration**: Particularly useful for imbalanced datasets. If your positive class (e.g., 'Buy' or 'Sell') is rare, a high precision at high recall indicates a strong model for that specific class. A curve that stays high on both axes is desirable.  
* **Calibration Curve (\*\_calibration\_plot.png)**:  
  * **Interpretation**: Compares the predicted probabilities to the actual fraction of positive outcomes. A perfectly calibrated model's curve would lie exactly on the diagonal line (y=x).  
  * **Consideration**: If the curve is below the diagonal, the model is overconfident (predicts probabilities too high). If it's above, it's underconfident. Calibration is important if you rely on the absolute probability values for decision-making (e.g., "only trade if probability \> **70%**").

By thoroughly reviewing these metrics and plots, you can gain deep insights into your model's performance, identify areas for improvement (e.g., feature engineering, different model architectures, handling imbalance), and make informed decisions about its suitability for live trading.
